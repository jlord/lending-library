# Tool Lending Library Website

![temp screenshot](http://raw.github.com/jlord/sheetsee-tool-lending/gh-pages/lending-ss.png)

**This is a work in progress.** I'm currently running [sheetsee-cache](http://www.github.com/jlord/sheetsee-cache) to develop it locally. When it's all said and done I'll switch it over to client-side [sheetsee.js](http://www.github.com/jlord/sheetsee.js). This repo will only have a gh-pages branch, which means every fork comes with a working, hosted by GitHub website! All one needs to do is change the spreadsheet key to their spreadsheet's key. More details on all of this when it's finished...
